# Product-Data-Scraper
This script reads excel files to scrape the data that you needed from a website.

<br><B>READ THIS BEFORE YOU TRY THE SCRIPT!<b/>

This script will work for you if:

1. The website you are trying to scrape has consistent links
<br>For example:
<br>"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=rice+cooker"
<br>From this sample, it is known that the link will always be "https://www.amazon.com/s?k=[insert_product_name]"

2. You have to know what you are looking for and it is accosiated with the consistent links
<br>For example:
<br>Product code:
<br>"https://www.amazon.com/s?k=[Product_Code]"

3. This script will only work if you change them accordingly
<br>-Read all the instructions within the script as it will guide you to suit the program for your need
<br>-You have to change the elements of the website so that the program can scrape the website properly
<br>-Scroll down and type the consistent link

That is all from me. I hope this program can help you with anything you are working on. 

Best regards from Berlin :)
